    definition: A programming structure that repeats a block of code.
  - term: Iteration
    definition: Each time a loop runs.
  - term: For Loop
    definition: A loop that repeats a fixed number of times.
  - term: While Loop
    definition: A loop that continues as long as a condition is true.
  - term: Infinite Loop

  - term: Break
    definition: A command that stops the loop before it finishes normally.
  - term: Continue
